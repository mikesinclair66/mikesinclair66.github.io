				Judson Lake is a beautiful body of water that spans across the border between Canada and the U.S.A. That is, it's
				beautiful when it's not dried up in the summer seasons, where the small depth of the lake can't seem to keep up
				with evaporation. The Canadian side of the land is owned by Willock Farms, a set of land owned and maintained by
				Walter Willms. The farm has been in his family for a long time now, having been previously owned by his father.

			<p>
				Although not very deep, Judson Lake is home to a multitude of wildlife. If you would like to see it for yourself,
				click the video below.
