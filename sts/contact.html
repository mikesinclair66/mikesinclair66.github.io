			<h2>Q&#38;A</h2>
			
			<h4>Question 1 - Will the lead bullets be removed in the process?</h4>
			<p>
				The shot is in the top layer of the lake ground, which would be removed during the excavation process.
				The excavation of the gravel is desired to be approximately 40 feet, as was recommended by BC Environment. This would
				allow the fish to survive in the summer when the lake literally dries up. As of now, the fish survive in two ponds
				during the summer which were dug before the Department of Fisheries and Oceans stopped the process.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Question 2 - Can the Canadian side be repaired without US involvement?</h4>
			<p>
				No. The lake straddles the border and is and has been used for hunting on both sides of the border. The US involvement
				would only be to deepen the lake as on the Canadian side. It is not taking farm land out of production, nor is it going
				to become an unusable site. We had a study done by Scott Consultants who have much expertise in reclaiming land in such
				a way so as not to disturb the fish and wildlife to an unnecessary degree. The gravel extraction from the lake would
				serve to pay for this project.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Question 3 - Who will pay for the work and what profit accrues to which private interests?</h4>
			<p>
				As was stated in the previous question, we believe the gravel extraction would pay for the deepening of the lake. Although there
				has been a minimal amount of research done on the amount and type of gravel in the lake, the profit would depend on
				this. The lake is owned privately in Canada so any profit would, of course, go to the owner. On the US side, the lake is
				owned by the State so the profit would go to the State. Twenty Six acres are owned by the Willock Farms and approximately
				Eighty Six Acres are owned by the US State of Washington.
			</p>
			
			<h4>Question 4 - You want me to contact some people to voice --- what?</h4>
			<p>
				We need you to contact the Department of Fisheries and Oceans as well as the City of Abbotsford and ask them pointedly,
				what they are doing about the Trumpeter Swans dying of lead poisoning, which comes from the lead pellets which they are
				ingesting from our very shallow waters. Quite frankly, with the lake drying out in summer, the fish suffer, and so does
				any other waterfowl that uses this lake which has water the rest of the year. With the lake only coming up to about one
				to two feet in depth, the Trumpeter Swans, thinking the lead pellets to be gravel, ingest these pellets and they are
				poisoned as a result. If you have ever seen these beautiful birds die of this poisoning you would want to do something
				about it too.
			</p>
			
			<div id="important">
				<h4>Question 5 - What will it take to get the deepening process started?</h4>
				<p>
					We need to have the cooperation of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans as well as the WA Department of Fish and
					Wildlife to take a stand on what most of them know is right. That is, to come alongside of us in making this project feasible;
					to help make this lake a safe haven for fish and wildlife.
				</p>
			</div>
			
			<h4>Question 6 - How can I help?</h4>
			<p>
				Send your comments written to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, to the Mayor of Abbotsford, to the Mayor of Sumas, to
				the Councillors of the City of Abbotsford, to Washington, Steve Seymour, WDFW, Watershed Steward Program, 3725 Dana Road
				Bellingham, WA 98225, Phone 360-676-2003, Brian Williams, 360-466-X250, Mark Henderson, email mhen461@ECY.WA.GOV as well as
				Whatcom County. Remember, every little bit of support helps! I NEED TO UPDATE THE CONTACTS ON THIS!!!
