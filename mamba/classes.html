        <p>
            Develop dynamic striking power in “The Art of 8 Limbs” with classes of intense physical conditioning where
            we train the body, the mind and the heart. In traditional Muay Thai, the intense physical conditioning is
            considered a doorway into developing focus, dedication, honesty, confidence, respect and ultimately
            happiness, if the practitioner so chooses. Mamba Martial Arts Academy provides both the advanced and amateur
            practitioner with what they need to achieve their fitness goals.

    <h1>MMA & Wrestling</h1>
    <div>
        <p>
            Master what it means to be an athlete by using a variety of martial arts styles. MMA is gaining popularity
            because it is a dynamic sport that uses a variety of martial arts styles. True MMA champions have mastered
            what it means to be an athlete by training in many of the striking and grappling arts. Many of the top MMA
            competitors have a black belt in two or more of the martial arts such as Jiu-jitsu, Judo and Karate; as well
            as mastering other martial arts like Boxing, Kickboxing and Wrestling, to name a few. Our wrestling is MMA
            focused, and you learn takedowns, how to set up your takedowns with strikes and how to control your opponent
            once on the ground in order to utilize jiu jitsu techniques and striking

    <p>
        Learn no-gi grappling techniques that will allow you to use less strength and more leverage; ultimately
        learning to control your opponent by controlling yourself. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is ultimately a life style of
        self-mastery that is based on the principles of efficiency, patience and control. It has become an
        ubiquitous part of MMA due to its sophisticated use of leverage and timing over speed and power. No-gi jiu
        jitsu is training in regular gym clothing instead of a kimono (aka "gi").

        In order to determine a student’s skill set progression, Mamba Martial Arts Academy routinely does belt tests
        for all students. Specific skills, knowledge and conditioning are expected to be demonstrated correctly for each
        belt level to be attained. The progression of the belt system is as follows: white, gray, yellow, orange, green,
        blue, purple, brown, black, red. However, instead of the traditional gi belt, as seen in many Jiu Jitsu schools,
        our belt levels are displayed by “Grading T-Shirts” of the applicable colour. All students are expected to come
        to class in a Team Mamba shirt.
