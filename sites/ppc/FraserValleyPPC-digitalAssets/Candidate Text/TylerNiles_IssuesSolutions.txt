• Indigenous Issues
- our local First Nation's have been subject to many injustices both past and present. Some reservations have the lowest poverty rates in Canada along with other socials issues like substance abuse, domestic violence, and suicide. Many lack basic services like clean water and proper sewer systems. 

•Solution
- these issues are clearly complex and its not possible to address them all in a single term, but the PPC will treat these issues with Respect, Fairness, Freedom, and Responsibility. We will ensure that indiginous communities can take more ownership of services they receive and allow them to better improve the community facilities. Along with this a Peoples Government will work to grow established individual property rights on reservations so as to empower the residents and increase the control on their own lives.


• Health Care, 
- paramedics are understaffed and over worked not only through this pandemic but long before with the opioid crisis that still has yet to be dealt with. 
- our hospitals have terribly long wait times when compared to hospitals across the United States and Europe, our Nurses, Doctors, and Surgerons are over worked and suffering under the pressure this pandemic has forced ontop of them.

•Solution 
- health care should be under the responsibility of provincial governments and not over seen by a singular federal government, giving provinces their own ability to dictate and decide what they do with their funding allowing them to reduce wait times and hire more paramedics.


• Firearms
- firearms rights are being stripped from upstanding law abiding citizens at an alarming rate, while criminals are getting reduced sentences. Currently the rules protect criminals while unfairly targeting properly licensed legal gun owners. 

•Solution
- the firearms act needs to be cleaned up and updated with effective measures to strengthen public saftey and impose stricter sentences on criminal gun use. Change fire arm classification to be based on function not looks or how it makes someone feel.
