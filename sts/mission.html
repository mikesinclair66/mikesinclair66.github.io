			<h2>Our Mission To Clean and Restore Judson Lake</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				Judson Lake is an important ecosystem, strategically located along the Pacific Flyway, playing host to more than sixty
				bird species including the Peregrine Falcon, Bald Eagle and several hawk and waterfowl species. Sadly, this wetland is
				in a severely degraded state as progressively receding water levels have facilitated the decrease of once abundant fish 
				populations, the spread of non-native noxious weeds (Purple Loosestrife) and the suffering lead poisoning deaths of far
				too many majestic Trumpeter Swans.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the dry lake floor during the summer months provides us the perfect opportunity to remove the toxic lead shot
				that has accumulated over decades.

			<h2>How We'll Do It</h2>
			<p>
				On behalf of Willock Farms, Walter Willms wants to conduct a project to dig Judson Lake deeper. This would provide many
				benefits for the wildlife residing in Judson Lake. For one, the shores and deepened lake grounds will be replaced with
				fresh ground. Because of this, the trumpeter swans will be once again able to live healthy lives and swallow grit/rocks
				in the land without risk of death from the lead bullets which have been banned since 1990.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only would this project save the swans, it would also save the wildlife living within the body of water, thereby saving
				the hawks and eagles which eat the different lake species. Judson Lake as of now is approximately seven feet deep. If Walter's
				plan succeeds, the lake will end up being approximately 40-50 feet deep. Once this is done, it would be nearly impossible for
				the lake to dry up, and the lilypads and excessive weeds will not reach the surface of the lake any longer. In result, the
				fish will not suffer a residence that is too small for them to live in.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Please Join The Fight To Restore Judson Lake by Raising Awareness Online!</h2>

				You can help the cause by helping us increase traffic to this site, thus raising awareness of the issue. If you're willing, share
				our site to showcase that there is an entire ecosystem to save.
