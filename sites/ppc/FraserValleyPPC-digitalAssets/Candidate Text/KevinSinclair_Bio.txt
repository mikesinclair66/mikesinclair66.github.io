Kevin Sinclair is a truck driver/driver trainer at Nutriva Group in Abbotsford, BC, a Fraser Valley agri-business focused on producing foods to improve health and wellness while fulfilling the vision of “making a difference for the common good”.

He is also a part time student at the University of the Fraser Valley and currently in his 3rd year of a Bachelor of Arts program majoring in Political Science. Kevin is a true advocate by nature, as evidenced by his self-explanatory website savetheswans.ca which promotes his House of Commons petition (Petition e-3459) to eliminate toxic lead shotgun shell ammunition nationwide and end needless wildlife deaths from lead poisoning in our country.

He enjoys spending quality time with family and friends, playing golf, reading and volunteering Friday evenings and/or Sunday afternoons at The Stream, a faith-based ministry dedicated to providing an encouraging word, a listening ear and a meal to at-risk people in Abbotsford’s downtown core.

Kevin is honored to stand with Maxime Bernier and the PPC to give Canadians the opportunity to join a party that espouses common sense policies that put Canadians first, and fights to defend timeless principles and values, the top of which include individual freedom, personal responsibility, fairness and respect.
