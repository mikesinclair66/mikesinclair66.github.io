Local Issues and Solutions (Chilliwack-Hope): 

1. Housing Availability and Affordability 

Soaring costs have been a real challenge in the Fraser Valley. Many are being priced out of the market, and rents are rising beyond their means.  

This issue cannot be fixed on the supply side only. B.C. is already producing housing units near to maximum capacity. We must bring down demand by reducing immigration to 1990s levels. 

We will also transfer tax points to the provinces, so provinces have the resources to address issues like housing. Solutions will require the support of community leaders to work, so let’s give the communities what they need -- and get out of their way. 


2. Poverty and Crime 

Adam Smith's said the essential elements to creating prosperity are “peace, easy taxes, and a tolerable administration of justice”. Canada is failing regarding these last two elements. 

The PPC will fight to reduce federal taxes while securing property rights and enabling individuals to secure the fruits of their own labor. We must reform the courts and the criminal code, reducing complexities and absurdities. 

The PPC will work to support and empower law enforcement through enhanced training, incentives, and reforms. Securing a tolerable administration of justice should be the highest priority in government spending. 

 
3. Growing Totalitarianism and the Suppression of our Charter Rights 

Courts, tribunals, law enforcement officers and human rights commissioners have all become too invested in policing Canadians on issues that ought not to concern governmental authorities or the criminal code. Ideologues within the other parties have been working to expand government censorship and are encouraging lawfare against ordinary citizens who happen to hold contrarian opinions. 

The PPC will oppose political correctness, champion Charter rights, and fight against draconian expansions of government control and the abuse of government power.
