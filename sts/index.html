				You may have heard the story: countless Trumpeter Swans are suffering and dying
				each year from ingesting toxic lead hunting shot. Nowhere is this occurrence more
				evident than Judson Lake, a lead shot polluted water body straddling the Canada/USA
				international border in Abbotsford, British Columbia and Whatcom County Washington.
			</p>
			<p>
				For decades duck hunters have blasted toxic lead shot into the floor of Judson Lake.
				Tragically, each winter, countless unsuspecting Trumpeter Swans needlessly die from
				ingesting the lead shot, thinking it is grit (small stones) needed to help digest
				their food.

				<h2>Did you know?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li id="first_value">
						<h4>Death rate</h4>
						<hr />
						<p>
							Over 2,000 Trumpeter Swans have died of lead poisoning at and near Judson
							Lake over the past several years.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Our outreach</h4>
						<hr />
						<p>
							Keeping the swans from using Judson Lake the past two winters (2006 - 2008),
							although done imperfectly, has coincided with a 75% decrease in Trumpeter Swan
							mortalities near the Canada/US border since 2004 (We've gone from back to back
							winters of approximately 400 local mortalities down to two consecutive winters with only 100).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li id="third_value">
						<h4>Our limit</h4>
						<hr />
						<p>
							Despite the fact that Judson Lake completely dries up each summer, providing the perfect
							opportunity to remove the lead shot, the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) and US Government
							Wildlife Agencies have not allowed the clean up and restoration of this blatant death trap.
						</p>
					</li>

			<h3>OFFICIAL REASONS FOR NOT RESTORING JUDSON LAKE</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					"If, by chance, the area is dredged and its use by swans is changed and the birds move off into other roost
					areas [ponds, lakes, rivers, etc.] that may potentially be worse, we may actually be causing more harm to
					the swans" (CWS Spokesperson on CTV News, 2003).
				</li><br />
				<li>
					"CWS observations are that Judson Lake is not a foraging area for Trumpeter Swans… The body of evidence to
					date indicates that Judson Lake is not 'a' or 'the' primary source of lead shot causing swan mortalities in
					the Sumas Prairie and Whatcom County area" (Environment Canada, 2004).
				</li><br />
				<li>
					"Scientists have ruled out Judson Lake as a source, because the birds only roost at the site and don't feed
					there" (CWS spokesperson in Abbotsford Times article, 2005).
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div id="important">
				<h3>WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HAVEN'T TOLD YOU</h3>
				<p>
					Over 50 of the dead swans that were examined in recent winters contained more than 100 lead pellets in their gizzards.
					“The mortalities containing more than 100 pellets were nearly all collected at Judson Lake
					(spanning the US/Canada border)” (WDFW, 2005).
				</p>
				<p>
					Only 7 swans that were known to be lead-free when they were captured and fitted with radio collars, and which subsequently
					died between 2001 and 2004, were confirmed to have died of lead poisoning. "Of these 7 lead-poisoned swans 6 visited Judson
					Lake (86%)”(Environment Canada, May 31, 2005).
				</p>
				<p>
					*None of these swans were captured and collared at Judson Lake.
				</p>

			<h3><i>2005/2006 SWAN LEAD MORTALITY SOIL/SEDIMENT SAMPLING PROJECT PRELIMINARY REPORT (UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON)</i></h3>
			<ul id="washington_post">
				<li>
					"Data from the swan lead mortality study [over the past seven years] leading to this sediment sampling project at
					Judson Lake [US side only] indicates that at least 89% of marked Pb poisoned (exposed to lead after marking) swans
					used the lake. In addition these swans roosted at Judson Lake 35% of the time."
				</li><br />
				<li>
					"Swans have been observed foraging at Judson Lake (presumably on pond lily, a large percentage of the available forage).
					In addition, during processing of soil samples collected at Judson Lake, lead pellets were frequently discovered
					entangled in the root mass of pond lily plants. As swans may consume up to 9 kg of aquatic vegetation in 24 hrs
					(James 2000), it is possible that swans foraging in Judson Lake may encounter and ingest many pellets over a period of days."
				</li><br />
				<li>
					"Lead pellet densities in the fields sampled this past winter do not appear to be at sufficient levels to provide for the
					recent swan mortalities in the Pacific Northwest. It is possible that portions of Judson Lake are of sufficient density to
					be the source of Pb pellets for some, if not many, of the swan mortalities we have seen over the past few years."

				<h3>WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						“Judson Lake Cleanup Should Become an International Reclamation Demonstration Project… The problems in the lake are numerous:
						dropping water levels, infestation by introduced foreign fish species, in-growth by invasive plants, and a general accumulation
						of noxious sludge, slime and lead shot on the lakebed… The BCWF stands ready to lead and facilitate the necessary discussion and
						planning to bring this project to fruition” (BC Wildlife Federation Press Release, 2005).
					</li><br />
					<li>
						“Judson Lake is one of a few lakes in the area that is an important wildlife habitat. It’s an important stopover area for
						migrating birds.” But it is also a very environmentally compromised lake because, as he explained, “Judson Lake is now in the very
						late stages of ecological succession. It could very easily cease to be a water body… His goal, Martin explained, is to restore
						Judson Lake “to a fully functioning lake and, in addition, it would be a side benefit if it helped the swans" (Al Martin, Director,
						BC Fish and Wildlife Department, January 13, 2006).
					</li><br />
					<li>
						“Each year hundreds of swans die from lead poisoning. This is most evident in the area of Judson Lake, a lake that spans the
						Canada/US border near Abbotsford. Though lead shot was banned in Canada in 1997, a long history of shooting in the area has caused
						a build up of lead shot on the lake bottom. Swans habitually ingest grit from the lake bottom to aid in digestion, but often eat
						the fatal lead by mistake” (Comox Valley Naturalists Society, 2005).
