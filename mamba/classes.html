    <h2>Muay Thai, Kickboxing & Boxing</h2>
    <p>
        Develop dynamic striking power in “The Art of 8 Limbs” with classes of intense physical conditioning where
        we train the body, the mind and the heart. In traditional Muay Thai, the intense physical conditioning is
        considered a doorway into developing focus, dedication, honesty, confidence, respect and ultimately
        happiness, if the practitioner so chooses. Mamba Martial Arts Academy provides both the advanced and amateur
        practitioner with what they need to achieve their fitness goals.
    </p>

    <h2>MMA & Wrestling</h2>
    <div class="imgAndInfo">

        <div>
            <p>
                Master what it means to be an athlete by using a variety of martial arts styles. MMA is gaining popularity
                because it is a dynamic sport that uses a variety of martial arts styles. True MMA champions have mastered
                what it means to be an athlete by training in many of the striking and grappling arts. Many of the top MMA
                competitors have a black belt in two or more of the martial arts such as Jiu-jitsu, Judo and Karate; as well
                as mastering other martial arts like Boxing, Kickboxing and Wrestling, to name a few. Our wrestling is MMA
                focused, and you learn takedowns, how to set up your takedowns with strikes and how to control your opponent
                once on the ground in order to utilize jiu jitsu techniques and striking
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Jiu Jitsu</h2>
    <p>
        Learn no-gi grappling techniques that will allow you to use less strength and more leverage; ultimately
        learning to control your opponent by controlling yourself. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is ultimately a life style of
        self-mastery that is based on the principles of efficiency, patience and control. It has become an
        ubiquitous part of MMA due to its sophisticated use of leverage and timing over speed and power. No-gi jiu
        jitsu is training in regular gym clothing instead of a kimono (aka "gi").
    </p>

    <h2>Weights & Conditioning</h2>
    <p>
        It takes an ample amount of conditioning and cardio to train in mixed martial arts. Consintently coming to
        class and practicing the techniques we teach will make you fit and on top of that we have all the neccessary
        machines and weights you will need to tone your muscles even more. And cardio macgines to increase your
        stamina. All members are welcome and encouraged to come during open mat times to use the weights and
        machines. Additionally, private lessons from our head coach or a fighter will help you to greatly increase
        your performance.

    <h2>Belt System</h2>
    <p>
        In order to determine a student’s skill set progression, Mamba Martial Arts Academy routinely does belt tests
        for all students. Specific skills, knowledge and conditioning are expected to be demonstrated correctly for each
        belt level to be attained. The progression of the belt system is as follows: white, gray, yellow, orange, green,
        blue, purple, brown, black, red. However, instead of the traditional gi belt, as seen in many Jiu Jitsu schools,
        our belt levels are displayed by “Grading T-Shirts” of the applicable colour. All students are expected to come
        to class in a Team Mamba shirt.
